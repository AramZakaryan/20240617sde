ISSUES DURING THE REALIZATION OF THE PROJECT

Beforeunload event lister is added with callback
referred to fetch with keepalive.

Snippet was added on 3.html. Usually they provide
self-contained, robust, and extensible solution
for integrating a tracking functionality into webpage.

To avoid preflight OPTIONS request, tracks are send
from client as URLSearchParams value and are parsed
by two middlewares, the first is express.urlencoded,
the second is custom middleware for parsing
URLSearchParams value.

The realization of the project took two days.


THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY,
I WILL APPRECIATE FOR ANY FEEDBACK.
