ISSUES DURING THE REALIZATION OF THE PROJECT

Initially, I started implementing a project that saved events
to local storage. But later I decided to simplify the project
and create trackBuffer as an Array to store tracks.
Second, I was thinking to store the trackBuffer as a Set
because that is an efficient way to store unique values.
But Set would not be effective if we take into account that
the "ts" property of a track is unix time, and two different
events (if they happen quickly) can have the same "ts" and,
as a consequence, the similar track.

The realization took two not full days.
